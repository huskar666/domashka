 <div style="width: 400px; margin:auto"> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"><i>The main goal</i> in the game <b>Dota 2</b> is to destroy the enemy 
    - a huge building on the enemy base in its center, reminiscent 
    of a magical citadel, while simultaneously defending against 
    attempts by the enemy team to do the same. If you destroy the
     throne before the opposing team, <i>you will</i> <b>win</b>.</p>

<div>  <b> Dota 2</b> is played by 2 teams of 5 people. Both teams have their own base in opposite corners
    of the map and defend it during the game. Each of the ten players independently controls a
     powerful character called a hero[6], each with unique abilities and a different play style.
      The team that first destroys the central building of the enemy base wins, for this the heroes 
      during the game try to kill the enemy heroes and supporting creatures (creeps) and destroy the
       defensive enemy buildings, thus gaining experience and gold for their development. If the hero dies,
        he is reborn <i>after some time</i>.
